A language that needs only spaces.

- How do i compile it ?
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sherry65-code/space.git
  cd space
  c++ ./space.cpp -o space
  ```
  
  And, Its compiled!

- What is the file extension
  
  The file extention is `.sp`
  
- How to write it
  
  It is probably the world's easiest language. It can only display ASCII Characters and has nothing else to do.
  Number of spaces in a single line define a single character.
  Refer to the [ASCII Characters Chart](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ascii) provided here to write the code.
  And thats it.

- How to run it
  ```bash
  ./space <filename>
  ```
  
  Then your binary file will be generated with the filename you provided.
